# BeeGame
The objective of this game is to click away all the bees!

This game was developed entirely in Java and it contains 2D movement physics and a various range of difficulties.
Difficulties affect the acceleration of bees as well as the general movement speed. 
When the cursor approves a bee, the bee speeds up to run away from the mouse.
The higher the difficulty the greater the multiplier that controls the bees acceleration away from the mouse. 
The bees next random location will be away from the mouse also, it will cancel current target location when the cursor is nearby. 

This game contains a scoring system. When you miss a click and hit the background rather than the bee, you will loose a point. When you click a bee you will gain a point. Simple!
This game saves your score to %appdata% and you can reset your score in the settings menu.

This game was developed by Cameron Morrison and assisted by Ged Robertson in year 1 of Bsc Software development and cyber security as a personal learning project.
