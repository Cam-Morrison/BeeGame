# BeeGame
The objective of this game is to save all the bees!
This game has an enviromentally friendly motive to insure any influence on younger audiences is indubitably beneficial.

This game was developed entirely in Java and it contains 2D movement physics and a various range of difficulties.
Difficulties affect the acceleration of bees as well as the general movement speed. 
When the cursor approaches a bee, the bee accelerates to distance itself from the mouse.
The higher the difficulty the greater the multiplier that controls the bee's acceleration away from the mouse. 
The bees next random location will be generated in an area distanced from the cursors current location, it will cancel current target location when the cursor is nearby. 

This game contains a scoring system. When you miss a click and hit the background rather than the bee, you will loose a point. When you click a bee you will gain a point. Simple!
This game safely stores your score to your computer in a text file. Your score can be reset in game.

This game was developed by Cameron Morrison and assisted by Ged Robertson in year 1 of Bsc Software development and cyber security as a personal learning project.
